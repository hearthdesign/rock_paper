# SPOCKY
## R.P.S.L.S. GAME â€“ HTML â€“ CSS â€“ JAVASCRIPT
## Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (RPSLS) â€“ Web Game
==SPOCKY== is a fun and interactive browser-based game inspired by the extended version of Rock Paper Scissors, made famous by *The Big Bang Theory*.

The aim of the game is to give anyone interested in games the opportunity to play this timeless game, which has existed throughout history and across many countries in various forms and with different rules.

This project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and provides an animated, audio-enhanced experience with multiple custom-designed opponents.

## Overview
The RPSLS game expands the classic Rock Paper Scissors by adding two new moves: Lizard and Spock. These additions introduce more variety and strategy, making the game more engaging.

This project began with a simple idea, a drawing, and inspiration from arcade games of the 1980s. The visual design â€” particularly the large, colorful, round buttons â€” was influenced by those classic machines. The aesthetics and straightforward logic of retro arcade games helped shape this digital version of RPSLS.

==SPOCKY== doesn't just recreate the RPSLS game; it also aims to evoke the nostalgic feeling of playing those vintage games. Additionally, the game features six opponents, each with unique avatars, moves, and a touch of humor.

## Testing
The site was tested on multiple physical devices and using browser developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools). It was designed mobile-first and uses relative units like percentages and rem, ensuring consistent scaling across screen sizes.

#### JavaScript Error Fix
An error occurred due to some elements (e.g., reset button or sound toggle) not existing on all pages. This caused addEventListener to throw errors.
The fix was to wrap event listener code in if conditions to check for the presence of those elements before attaching handlers.

### Validator Testing

### HTML
No errors returned from the W3C HTML Validator

### CSS
No critical errors from the W3C CSS Validator (Jigsaw)
4 warnings due to use of WebKit scrollbar styling, which isnâ€™t recognized in Firefox. A Firefox-compatible fallback has been implemented, but the warnings still appear as expected.
